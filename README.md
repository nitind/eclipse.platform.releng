This is the WTP-specific branch with EPL v2 rewrite. Be sure to check the **Copyright Tool** preference page for options, including how to specify which commits should not count as a modification. The EPL rewriting feature is disabled by default. Also check the console output for any files under the "Retains a reference to an outdated license, EPL v1.0" line. This will typically catch any properties file values that refer to EPL v1.0.
